Commands:
npm run build-investigate - Builds the investigate app (populating its Dist folder) in development mode.
npm run dev-investigate - Hosts the Investigate app on localhost:3000 in development mode.


For development purposes, this is being hosted on LVS Dev's webserver (LVSVDWSLWB01.consiliotest.com) on port 3000. To deploy, build the app then copy the contents of the dist/Investigate folder to the webserver (\\LVSVDWSLWB01.consiliotest.com\App\Sage\Investigate).
